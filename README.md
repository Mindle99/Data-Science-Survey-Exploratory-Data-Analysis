# Data-Science-Survey-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## About this Project

This project is to demonstrate the importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA), or data exploration, in the process of performing data analysis. Throughout this project I will explore the data to:
1. Understand the variables of the dataset
2. Clean the dataset
3. Analyze any possible relationships between variables within the dataset

## Overview
For the fourth year in a row, the annual Data Science Survey Challenge went live in October. With 20,036 responses, this survey helps to provide insight to the current state of data science. Kaggle turned to its users, challenging them to create an original narative using the survey data, to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), while also focusing on documentation, which are all key components to being a data scientist.

A more in depth view of the overview, rules, and data can be found on the kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/overview.

The inspiration to start this EDA project came from Data & Scientist Youtuber Ken Jee, when he posted a video talking about how he was going to work on it. The video can be found on Youtube, by following the link below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-DR9HBaipU

## Objective
The objective of the challenge is to tell a story about a certain subset of the data science community from the survey by means of EDA and story telling.

## Data
Main Data:
`kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv`: 39+ questions and 20,036 responses

- Responses to multiple choice questions (only a single choice can be selected) were recorded in individual columns. Responses to multiple selection questions (multiple choices can be selected) were split into multiple columns (with one column per answer choice).

Supplementary Data:
`kaggle_survey_2020_answer_choices.pdf`: list of answer choices for every question

With foodnotes desceribing which questions were asked to which respondents.
